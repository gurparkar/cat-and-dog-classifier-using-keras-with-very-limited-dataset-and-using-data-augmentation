# cat-and-dog-classifier-using-keras-with-very-limited-dataset-and-using-data-augmentation\
 
 
 its a very simple program but we have used data augmentation because of small data set .we have used only 2000 train images of cats and dogs and
 1000 each and 802 validation images and 401 for each class
 you can download the dataset from kaggle competition as well as from internet just follow the prodecure given in the code .In thsi project we get 
 79% accuracy with a very little data.
